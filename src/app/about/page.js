      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Huerta’s Albuquerque Jerky began as a family hobby in the mid‑1990s when
        Mark Huerta and his family started experimenting with thin‑cut beef jerky
        seasoned with red and green chile. Over the years, their unique base
        flavor and perfected drying technique earned rave reviews from friends,
        family, and local fair‑goers. In 2025, the Huertas decided to turn
        their passion into a small business.

      <p>
        Today, Huerta’s Albuquerque Jerky is still handmade in small batches,
        using local ingredients whenever possible. Our jerky isn’t too crispy or
        too chewy—it’s just right, with bold flavors that stand out from the
        rest. From our Christmas blend to our fiery habanero, we invite you to
        taste the difference of jerky made with heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re proud to call Albuquerque home and to share a piece of New
        Mexico’s culinary heritage with every bag.
